# osc-parser

Having read a blog post by Joe Armstrong about OSC messages, I set out to make a little OSC parser/reporter in Java.

Unsure whether it is correct - it's purely based off Joe's description - or even bug free.

Takes what may or may not be an OSC message from standard in and outputs a report of its contents.
